# ZeldaLikeGame

Made this following a Youtube tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4vbr3u7UKWp0iM1WIfRjCDTI03u43Zfu

But I did altered some codes and did some modifications. I might not add all the features from the tutorial and looking further into the tutorial there are also some functions that are missing (not yet covered), for example the sound/music. It's been a few years since the tutorial was updated. 

This is still a WIP.

I'm planning to finish making this game and hopefully to publish it probably at itch.io or something. It's going to be a short game because the main purpose is to get this published as my first game. Hopefully.

Still at part 30+ video for now, not even half finished. 

// 02.02.2023
Probably somewhere at part 60+ video, but I did skipped a few videos. Will revisit later in the future.
